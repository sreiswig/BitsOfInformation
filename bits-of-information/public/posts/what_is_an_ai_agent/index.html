<h1>What is an AI Agent?</h1>
<div class="content">
  <p>A Computer can never be held accountable
Therefore a computer must never
make a management decision</p>
<p>Is it just a fad?
Force LMM to use tool at appropriate time to achieve a longer goal?
Is an LMM the correct tool for the job?
What is planning and reasoning? What is the source of it?
LMMs are slow compared to purpose build ML.
What&rsquo;s new in Reinforcement Learning?
Dynamic Flows</p>
<p>Hypothesis, planning an reasoning came about after tool use and for predicting the manipulation of the environment around them.
Recent ML and RL have focused on a fixed environment.
LLMs operate in their chat or with a fixed number of functions they can call.
RL tests have focused on completing a specific game.
These models don&rsquo;t manipulate the environment and augment their capabilities.
Language is a tool that Humans invented for the purpose of survival.</p>
