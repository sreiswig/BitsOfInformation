  <p>Given a sequence predict 5 3d structures for that sequence.
Sequences are given as a string of A, C, G, U.
Some of the training sequences have other characters.</p>
<p>Steps to begin.</p>
<p>1 Custom Tokenizer:
Reasoning: Each of the letters have a different meaning from regular
Language usage that isn&rsquo;t guranteed to be captured in LLM training.
Probably more efficient too.
Can skip this if using an LLM because it&rsquo;s build to handle the tokens it was trained on.</p>
<p>2 Custom Embedding:
The meaning of these sequences are different from Language useage.
Piggybacking off of Language embedding of the letter A should not be useful.
What does the relation of A to C to G to U even mean?
And going back to the tokenizer what&rsquo;s a good subsequence?
How doe they affect the larger sequence?
Sequences of subsequences? how will this be captured?
Attention to get the most relevant pieces of the sequence?</p>
<p>Anyway</p>
<p>3 creating the points
What does this mean?
What is our current goal? Sequence -&gt; Set (Class Point)</p>
<p>Should I use an LLM?
No
I will try:
Graph attention -&gt; 3d Conv -&gt; points
Logically thinking about things I feel this is the way.</p>
