The Logitech G600's left click is going bad and the switch on the board needs to be replaced.

Would also like to upgrade the mouse if possible without replacing the entire board.

Change the usb-A cable to a usb-C female port.
Add a battery to power the mouse.

Add a wireless transmitter and wireless reciever.
